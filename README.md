# Welcome to MAKO IoT
MAKO IoT is a platform for building IoT applications based on .NET. It leverages the power of C# language and software best practices. It is based on [.NET nanoFramework](https://www.nanoframework.net/)

The goal of MAKO IoT is to provide:
* across-the-board development experience with highest software industry standard best practices
* building blocks for common tasks / functionalities
* templates and boilerplate which make doing right things easy and doing wrong things hard
* tools & practices

# Build your app with MAKO IoT
Create two [nanoFramework projects](https://docs.nanoframework.net/content/getting-started-guides/index.html). Implement your logic in the first one, along with unit tests. In the second project connect all components and implement hardware-specific logic. This project is the entry point to the code running on your device.

Take a look at [Samples/Messaging](https://github.com/CShark-Hub/mako-iot/tree/main/Samples/Messaging), you can find detailed explanation there.
